Plus, you'll avoid that whole, \\"I don't know anyone here.\\" phase.It's much easier to get to know each other if we have a private/semi-private room where we can mingle over lunch, and also do more formal introductions to the whole group during the meal. So be prepared to tell us who you are and what makes your heart sing.We'll be breaking bread at Mother's Bistro & Bar in Downtown Portland. (Only 10 min. walk to WDS Headquarters) It's highly rated on Yelp and TripAdvisor. They serve American cuisine with menu items in the $7 - $20 range.If there's an interest, we could continue this meetup back in NYC and help each other shatter our goals and aspirations.Hope to see you there.Paul J.

Find out more about how I found the secrets to slow success by measurably cooking food from all 196 countries in the world, writing a book for National Geographic, and being vulnerable enough to cry on stage last year at WDS (one of the best moments of my life!!). Hear my story and share yours while enjoying Japanese Food at the Koji Osakaya Restaurant directly across from the main WDS theater. Your first Sapporo will be on me!
